# PRAXO-CORE Lua Registry Introduction

**Status:** published. Source version `0.6.0-1`, source
tag `lua/v0.6.0`. Published registry version: `0.6.0-1`. Registry
pages are release snapshots; verify the published version before relying on a
feature.

## Positioning

PRAXO-CORE is an embeddable, MIT-licensed agent framework. This rock is its native Lua Core: an agent loop with tool registration and dispatch, policy hooks, typed events, memory, checkpoints, context budgets, middleware, JSON Schema validation, plugin manifest parsing, and human-in-the-loop interrupt decisions.

## Boundaries

- PRAXO-CORE is an embeddable, MIT-licensed execution kernel, not a hosted
  model, workflow engine, identity provider, or safety controller.
- Do not infer exactly-once execution, complete sandbox isolation, production
  security certification, live-provider behavior, or physical safety from this
  package.
- Check the registry page and source tag for the exact version; source READMEs
  and canonical documentation may be newer than a published registry page.
